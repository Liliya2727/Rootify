**Last Updated: 11 February 2026**

Rootify is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. DATA COLLECTION

Rootify is a "Privacy-First" application.

- **NO PERSONAL INFORMATION**: We do not collect names, emails, or phone numbers.
- **NO EXTERNAL STORAGE**: We do not store any user data on external servers.
- **NO TRACKING**: We do not use any third-party analytics, trackers, or advertising IDs.

## 2. LOCAL DATA PROCESSING

All system optimizations, resource monitoring, and configuration changes are processed locally on your device. Any logs generated by the Logcat feature are stored in your device's private storage or exported only when you explicitly choose to do so.

## 3. PERMISSIONS & USAGE

Rootify requires certain permissions to function effectively:

- **ROOT ACCESS**: Necessary to perform system-level tweaks and access system logs (Logcat).
- **FILE STORAGE**: Used to save your preferred configurations and export log files.
- **NETWORK ACCESS**: Used only to provide external links to the official GitHub repository and Telegram Support Group. No data is transmitted in the background.

## 4. THIRD-PARTY LINKS

The application contains links to external sites (GitHub, Telegram). These sites have their own privacy policies, and Rootify is not responsible for their content or practices.

## 5. DATA SECURITY

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of your data being compromised from our side. We recommend keeping your device secure and managing root permissions carefully.
